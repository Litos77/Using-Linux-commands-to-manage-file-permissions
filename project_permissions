# Project description
Authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. It's important because without authorization any user could access and modify all files belonging to other users or system files. 
This would certainly be a security risk.

In Linux, file and directory permissions are used to specify who has access to specific files and directories. 

To complete this task, I performed the following tasks:

## Check file and directory details
This document displays the file structure of the /home/researcher2/projects directory and the permissions of the files and subdirectory it contains.
In the /home/researcher2/projects directory, there are five files with the following names and permissions.

To check this, I run this command in the Shell terminal:



+ **project_k.txt**
  * User = read, write,
  * Group = read, write
  * Other = read, write
  
+ **project_m.txt**
  * User = read, write
  * Group = read
  * Other = none
  
+ **project_r.txt**
  * User= read, write
  * Group = read, write
  * Other = read
  
+ **project_t.txt**
  * User = read, write
  * Group = read, write
  * Other = read
  
+ **.project_x.txt**
  * User = read, write
  * Group = write
  * Other = none

There is also one subdirectory inside the projects directory named drafts. The permissions on drafts are:
+ User = read, write, execute
+ Group = execute
+ Other = none
